- what do you mean by "other previous researches used older machine learning algorithm in building their modles"? You have to clearly explain this and why any learning methods which is not DNN considered to be traditional

In this research, we consider all machine learning algorithm used above as the traditional machine learning as it will be differentiated and compared to deep learning algorithm which is actually subset from machine learning methods but it differs is in the use of neural networks that contain more than one hidden layer.


- You have to explain a little bit about differences between MLP, LSTM, GRU and give some references to it

- some grammatical errors.

- Studies in the field of psychology showed that there is a correlation between personality and tthe linguistic behaviour of a person (mairesse et al, 2007) (done)

-explain how to label manual gathering dataset (done)

- differentiated model of machine learning and deep learning is biased as they are using different features

- cite the average rather than the highest (done)

- why extraversion is easier to predict than the other (done)
(it is depends on the feature and dataset that being used)
